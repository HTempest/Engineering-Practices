## Scope

These Engineering practices apply to all H Tempest Ltd employees, contractors, and temporary workers involved in the development, support and maintenance of software.

## Background

The SDLC must address common business and development phases to be effective across the enterprise, and must address key issues of security, accessibility, mobile device access, and regulatory compliance.

## Exceptions

A business case for non-compliance must be established and the request for exemption approved in advance through a risk acceptance process where the Managing Director, Head of IT and Head of Software Engineering are notified and approval for the exception is granted.
