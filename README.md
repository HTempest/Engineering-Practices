# About this book

This book

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to standardise the Software Development Lifecycle \(SDLC\) that produces mission critical web applications and web services through the use of industry leading practices for H Tempest Ltd and it's subsidiaries. These applications and services typically deal with personal and commercially sensitive data requiring due diligence to protect the data. Standardising the development approach and coding techniques for these systems will ensure their maintainability, security, protection against cyber-attacks and compliance with relevant legislation.

## Scope

These Engineering practices apply to all H Tempest Ltd employees, contractors, and temporary workers involved in the development, support and maintenance of software.

## Background

The SDLC must address common business and development phases to be effective across the enterprise, and must address key issues of security, accessibility, mobile device access, and regulatory compliance.

## Exceptions

A business case for non-compliance must be established and the request for exemption approved in advance through a risk acceptance process where the Managing Director, Head of IT and Head of Software Engineering are notified and approval for the exception is granted.
